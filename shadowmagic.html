All creatures to be affected by Deep Slumber must be within a 30-ft. radius. Creatures in the area of effect must make a Saving Throw vs. Death with a -3 penalty or fall asleep.

The target creature suffers 2 points of magical damage + 2 points per 2 levels of the caster to a maximum of 10 total at 9th level while the shadow adept gains an equal amount of Hit Points. If the shadow adept goes over &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; maximum Hit Point total with this spell, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; loses any extra Hit Points after 1 turn.</p>

<p>If the target is slain, the amount of health gained by the caster is doubled.</p>

<p><strong>Shadow Veil</strong><br />

Casting Time: 9<br />

<p>By means of this spell, the shadow adept creates a magical field of force that serves as armor, increasing the caster's armor class by 1 point per 3 levels of the caster up to a maximum of +4 at level 13. It is cumulative with Dexterity bonuses to Armor Class. The veil is invisible, does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, and doesn't prevent spellcasting. It lasts until successfully dispelled or until its duration expires.</p>

<p>Additionally, whenever the caster suffers damage while the shadow veil is active, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; has a 5% (+5% per ten caster levels) chance to turn invisible for 2 rounds.</p>

<p><strong>Curse</strong><br />
(Conjuration/Summoning – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 1<br />
Range: Sight<br />
Duration: 1 turn<br />
Casting Time: 1 round<br />
Area of Effect: 30 ft. radius<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>When the Curse spell is uttered, the caster lowers the morale of enemy creatures and penalizes their saving throws and attack rolls by -1. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 30 ft. radius centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effects; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not. This spell is not affected by Magic Resistance.</p>

<p><strong>Shadow Rope</strong><br />
(Conjuration/Summoning – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 1<br />
Range: Visual range of the caster<br />
Duration: Special<br />
Casting Time: 1<br />
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>This spell creates a shadowy thread which wraps itself around the caster's target and pulls them towards the caster. It deals no damage, but the target is immobilized for the duration and is unable to attack or use spells for one round.</p>

Casting Time: 1<br />
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p><strong>Mesmerize</strong><br />
(Enchantment/Charm – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 1<br />
Range: Visual range of caster<br />
Duration: 1 turn<br />
Casting Time: 1<br />
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>This spell inflicts an enchantment upon a target creature of the shadow adept's choice. If the target fails a Save vs. Spells at -4, they are pacified for one turn, ceasing all action and remaining still for the duration. The target also suffers a -6 penalty to Armor Class due to being too mentally unfocused to actively dodge attacks. However, the target will break free of its enchantment prematurely if they are attacked.</p>

<p><strong>Cursed Flames</strong><br />
(Alteration – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 1<br />
Range: 5 ft.<br />
Duration: Special<br />
Casting Time: 1<br />
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
Saving Throw: 1/2</p>

<p>When the shadow adept casts this spell, a jet of searing flame shoots from &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; fingertips. The shadow adept's hands must be held so as to send forth a fanlike sheet of flames: &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; thumbs must touch each other and the fingers must be spread. The burning hands send out flame jets of 5 ft. length in a horizontal arc of about 120 degrees in front of the shadow adept. All targets within range take 1d4+10% of their maximum hit points in fire damage and have their Luck reduced by two points for 2 rounds + 1 round per level to a maximum of 10 rounds at 9th level, additionally, they take 2 points of fire damage per round for the duration. A successful Saving Throw vs. Spells negates the maximum hit points damage and the secondary effects.</p>

<a NAME="2ND"></a><h2>2nd Level Spells</h2>

<p><strong>Dark Mirage</strong><br />
(Illusion/Phantasm – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 2<br />
Range: 0<br />
Duration: 1 hour<br />
Casting Time: 2<br />
Area of Effect: The caster<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>When Dark Mirage is cast, the shadow adept causes the outline of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; form to become blurred, shifting and wavering. This distortion causes all missile and melee attacks against the caster to be made with a -3 penalty. The shadow adept also gains a +1 bonus to all of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Saving Throws. Additionally, the caster causes from 2 to 8 exact duplicates of &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;self to come into being around &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;. These images do exactly what the shadow adept does. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual shadow adept. When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack—magical or otherwise—it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact until they are struck. However, it is important to note that this will not protect the caster against every attack, as it is possible for an enemy to choose the real caster amongst all the images.</p>

<p><strong>Night Terrors</strong><br />
(Necromancy – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 2<br />
Range: 40 ft.<br />
Duration: 1 turn<br />
Casting Time: 2<br />
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius<br />
Saving Throw: Neg.</p>

<p>All enemies within the area of effect when this spell is cast must Save vs. Spell at -2 or flee in terror. Certain creatures are immune to the effects of fear, including all undead.</p>

<p>From 14th level onwards, this spell gains the effects of the 6th level wizard spell Death Spell: creatures below 8 Hit Dice and all summoned creatures will die instantly from overwhelming fear. (no saving throw)</p>

<p><strong>Dark Fortune</strong><br />
(Enchantment/Charm – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 2<br />
Range: 15 ft.<br />
Duration: 1 hour<br />
Casting Time: 2<br />
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>The recipient of this spell gains extraordinary luck for the next hour, receiving a +1 bonus to &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Saving Throws, attack rolls, and minimum damage/healing rolls as well as +5% to all thieving skills. Furthermore, damage dice for all effects outside a weapon's base damage dealt towards the target is reduced by 1, while the target's damage dice are increased by 1. For example, a 6d6 fireball will do 6d5 damage, and a flaming long sword that deals 1d8+2 slashing plus 1d3 fire damage will deal 1d8+2 slashing plus 1d2 fire damage instead. Bonuses increase by the original amount for every five caster levels after 3rd level up to 23rd level. This spell also makes the target immune to effects that reduce luck, such as Doom or Greater Malison.</p>

<p><strong>Power Word, Sleep</strong><br />
(Conjuration/Summoning – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 2<br />
Range: 90 ft.<br />
Duration: 5 rounds<br />
Casting Time: 1<br />
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>When a shadow adept calls upon a Power Word, Sleep spell, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; causes a comatose slumber to come upon 1 creature (other than undead and certain other creatures specifically excluded from the spell's effects). The creature targeted must have less than 20 Hit Points and gets no Saving Throw. Magically sleeping opponents can be attacked with substantial bonuses. The Sleep effect will last for 5 rounds. This spell has no effect on creatures with more than 20 Hit Points.</p>

<p>At 10th level, creatures above 20 Hit Points are put to sleep for 2 rounds. This spell is not affected by Magic Resistance.</p>

<p><strong>Dread Silence</strong><br />
(Alteration – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 2<br />
Range: Visual range of the caster<br />
Duration: 2 rounds/level<br />
Casting Time: 5<br />
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius sphere<br />
Saving Throw: Neg.</p>

<p>Upon casting this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible and spells cannot be cast. Each creature in the area must make a Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -5 penalty; if the save is failed then they are silenced for the duration of the spell. Note that this spell does not continue to affect the area after being cast; only those in the area at the time of the casting are affected by the silence. Only the caster is immune to the spell's effects - both allies and enemies can be affected.</p>

<p><strong>Ghostly Visage</strong><br />

<p>Level: 2<br />
Range: Self<br />
Duration: 1 turn/level<br />

<p>Level: 2<br />
Range: Touch<br />

Casting Time: 1<br />
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>This spell allows the shadow adept to drain two points of Constitution from a single target, increasing the caster's own for 1 turn. Drain Vitality (and its variants) does not cost Constitution as other spells of the Shadow Weave and may not affect the same target more than once per turn.</p>

<p><strong>Black Mist</strong><br />
(Illusion/Phantasm – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 2<br />
Range: 90 ft.<br />
Duration: 1 turn<br />
Casting Time: 2<br />
Area of Effect: 50' radius<br />
Saving Throw: Neg.</p>

<p>When this spell is cast, a thick shadowy mist spreads across the area selected by the caster. Any creatures caught within the mist must make a Save vs. Spells at -2 at the beginning of each round or become blinded for that round, receiving a -4 penalty to their Armor Class and attack rolls and greatly reducing their vision range. Those who make successful Saving Throws can leave the mist without suffering any ill effects, although those remaining in the mist must continue to save each round. A Dispel Magic will remove the blindness on a particular character, but if they remain in the mist, then they are still subject to its effects.</p>

<p><strong>Negative Energy Ray</strong><br />
(Necromancy – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 2<br />
Range: 15 ft.<br />

The ray strikes a second time halfway through its duration, dealing the same amount of damage and applying a second instance of penalties. The caster may move while the spell is in effect. There is no saving throw against this spell's effects.</p>

<p><strong>Sigil of Vulnerability</strong><br />
(Enchantment/Charm – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 2<br />
Range: 30 ft.<br />
Duration: 1 round/level<br />
Casting Time: 1 round<br />
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
Saving Throw: Neg.</p>

<p>This spell curses the target creature with mortality. For as long as the curse is in effect, the target loses 1% resistance to physical damage per level of the caster and is unable to be healed by any magical means. A Saving Throw vs. Spells negates the effect.</p>

<p><strong>Shadow Walk</strong><br />
(Alteration – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 2<br />
Range: 0<br />
Duration: Instant<br />
Casting Time: 1<br />
Area of Effect: The caster<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>This spell transports the caster to any place within the visual range of the caster. When the spell is cast, the shadow adept makes a brief planar jaunt into the Plane of Shadow and exits at a different location, making it seem as though &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; has teleported. The caster is also briefly invisible for the travel duration, cancelling spells targeted at &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; unless the spellcaster can see through invisibility.</p>

<p><strong>Hallucinate</strong><br />
(Illusion/Phantasm – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 2<br />
Range: Visual range of the caster<br />
Duration: 1 round/level<br />
Casting Time: 5 <br />
Area of Effect: 1 person or mammal <br />
Saving Throw: Neg.</p>

<p>The target of this spell must make a Saving Throw vs. Spell or come under its effects. When under the effects of the Hallucinate spell, the victim experiences a disruption of their senses causing them to perceive something that is not actually there, causing them to randomly wander, attack the nearest person, or stand confused.</p>

<p><strong>Shadowfade</strong><br />
(Illusion/Phantasm – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 2<br />
Range: Touch <br />
Duration: Special <br />
Casting Time: 2 <br />
Area of Effect: 1 creature <br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>This spell causes the creature touched to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or its gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. The caster cannot perform any actions that manipulate the environment around &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;, such as opening doors, disarming a trap, or opening a chest. The caster can, however, cast defensive spells on &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;self and fellow party members. And if &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; attacks, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; to attack first.</p>

<p>Additionally, if the target is either a shadow adept or a native of the Shadow Plane, they are healed for 1d6 hit points (+1d6 per five caster levels).</p>

<a NAME="3RD"></a><h2>3rd Level Spells</h2>

<p><strong>Blackfire Arrow</strong><br />
(Conjuration/Summoning – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 3<br />
Range: 60 ft.<br />
Duration: Instant<br />
Casting Time: 3<br />
Area of Effect: Special<br />
Saving Throw: 1/2</p>

<p>This spell enables the caster to hurl coldfire bolts at multiple opponents within range. Each bolt inflicts 1d6 points of cold damage plus 4d6 points of fire damage. Only half of the fire damage is inflicted if the creature struck saves vs. Spell. The caster receives one bolt every 5 levels beyond the 5th (2 bolts at 10th level, 3 at 15th level, etc.). Each arrow may be targeted individually towards any chosen target.</p>

<p><strong>Shadowblast</strong><br />
(Invocation/Evocation – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 3<br />
Range: 40 ft.<br />
Duration: Instant<br />
Casting Time: 3<br />
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius<br />
Saving Throw: 1/2</p>

<p>The shadow adept launches an unstable mass of shadowstuff which explodes, dealing 1d3 points of cold damage and 1d3 points of magic damage for every level of the caster (to a maximum of 10d6) and penalizes their saving throws and attack rolls by -1 per 10 levels of the caster (-2 at 10th level, -3 at 20th level, etc.) for 1 turn. Creatures who pass their saving throw (-1 penalty per 5 levels) avoid the direct blast taking no magic damage or stat loss.</p>

<p>From 10th level onwards, targets damaged by Shadowblast lose 20% resistance to cold and magic damage for 1 turn.</p>

<p><strong>Inertia</strong><br />
(Alteration – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 3<br />
Range: 25 ft.<br />
Duration: 1 turn<br />
Casting Time: 3<br />
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius<br />
Saving Throw: Neg.</p>

<p>This spell causes creatures to move and attack at half of their normal rates. It negates Haste, but does not otherwise affect magically hasted or slowed creatures. Slowed creatures have an Armor Class and attack penalty of -4. Creatures save at -4 vs. Spell. Targets must also make an initial Save vs. Spells or be slowed to a halt, becoming held for 1 round.</p>

<p><strong>Lifedrinker Touch</strong><br />
(Necromancy – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 3<br />
Range: Touch<br />
Duration: Instant <br />
Casting Time: 3 <br />
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>When this spell is cast, the target loses 1d6 Hit Points for every 2 caster levels, to a maximum drain of 6d6 for a 12th-level caster. In addition, the target transfers 3 points of either Strength, Dexterity or Constitution to the caster. The Hit Points are added to the caster's current Hit Points, with any Hit Points over the caster's normal maximum treated as temporary additional Hit Points. The temporary Hit Points and statistics last for 1 hour.</p>

<p>Note: This spell may not be cast multiple times to radically increase the caster's Hit Points. The caster must wait for the first Lifedrinker Touch spell to run its course before casting another.</p>

<p><strong>Beguile</strong><br />
(Enchantment/Charm – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 3<br />
Range: 60 ft.<br />
Duration: 5 rounds<br />
Casting Time: 3<br />
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
Saving Throw: Neg.</p>

<p>This spell works in the exact same manner as Charm Person, with one difference: There is no Saving Throw bonus. Beguile affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell to negate the effect.</p>

<p>If the spell's recipient fails &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Saving Throw, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>If the caster harms - or attempts to harm - the charmed person by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed person, the Beguile spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; was charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; is charmed.</p>

<p>The saving throw penalty increases by -1 for every 5 caster levels.</p>

<p><strong>Shadow Comets</strong><br />
(Invocation/Evocation – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 3<br />
Range: 0<br />
Duration: Special<br />
Casting Time: 3<br />
Area of Effect: The caster<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>This spell creates several small globes of shadowy matter, two for each experience level of the shadow adept, which are held in &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; hands in place of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; usual weapons. The meteors can be hurled at targets up to 270 feet away and are treated as missiles with a +5 bonus to the attack rolls. Each meteor bursts into a 1-ft. diameter sphere upon impact, inflicting 1d4+3 points of damage plus an additional 3 points of cold damage to any creature struck. The shadow adept may hurl up to five missiles per round.</p>

<p><strong>Shadow Binding</strong><br />
(Enchantment/Charm – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 3<br />
Range: 35 ft.<br />
Duration: 1 turn<br />
Casting Time: 3<br />
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
Saving Throw: Neg.</p>

<p>This spell holds one creature of any type rigidly immobile and in place for one turn, unless a Saving Throw vs. Spell is made with a -4 penalty. Those who succeed on their Saving Throws are totally unaffected by the spell.</p>

<p>Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subject's condition due to wounds, diseases, or poison.</p>

<p><strong>Impose</strong><br />
(Invocation/Evocation – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 3<br />
Range: 30 ft.<br />

Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>Level: 3<br />
Range: 70 ft.<br />
Duration: Special<br />
Casting Time: 5<br />
Area of Effect: Path of spear<br />
Saving Throw: Neg.</p>

<p>Upon casting this spell, a spear made of shadowstuff forms in the caster's hands, which can be thrown once towards a target of the caster's choosing. The spear may be launched by any target the caster is able to attack, dispelling all of the spell protections of 5th level and lower affecting it. This includes the following spells: Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, and Minor Spell Turning. If no such spells protect the targets, the spear instead deals 5d6 magic damage and inflicts an additional effect dependent on the caster's level.</p>

<p>5th level and below: Reduces targets' Armor Class by two points for five rounds<br />
8th-10th level: Reduces targets' saving throws and THAC0 by 1 point for five rounds<br />

<p><strong>Cursed Earth</strong><br />
(Conjuration – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 3<br />
Range: 90 ft.<br />
Duration: 1 turn<br />
Casting Time: 4<br />
Area of Effect: 30' radius<br />
Saving Throw: Neg.</p>

<p>This spell creates a zone of blackened, poisonous earth within a 30' radius. All creatures standing within the area must make a Saving Throw vs. Death at -4 each round or suffer 2d4 poison damage and have their movement rate halved.</p>

<p><strong>Expunge Magic</strong><br />
(Abjuration – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 3<br />
Range: 40 ft.<br />
Duration: Instant<br />
Casting Time: 5<br />
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>A Expunge Magic spell removes magical effects upon anyone within the area. This includes effects given from spells, potions and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Turning and Spell Deflection. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the effective level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled (Expunge Magic is cast as though at 1.5x the caster's actual level). The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of the Expunge Magic is above the original caster, &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Expunge Magic is below the original caster, &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 5% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; is trying to dispel, there is only a 5% chance of failure. Similarly if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.</p>

<p>Note: While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect.</p>

<p><strong>Void Edge</strong><br />
(Invocation/Evocation – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 3<br />
Range: Self<br />
Duration: 1 turn<br />
Casting Time: 2<br />
Area of Effect: Self<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>Upon casting this spell, the shadow adept imbues &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; next melee attack with shadow magic, providing it with a +5 enchantment bonus and the ability to drain 2 hit points per level as magic damage.</p>


<a NAME="4TH"></a><h2>4th Level Spells</h2>

<p><strong>Fireshield (Shadow)</strong> <br />
(Invocation/Evocation, Alteration – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 4<br />
Range: 0<br />
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level<br />
Casting Time: 4 <br />
Area of Effect: The caster <br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>The shadow fireshield protects the user from cold damage by surrounding the caster with a shield of black flame. This shield not only grants the user 50% resistance to cold, but also protects the caster from attacks made within a 5-ft. radius around the caster. An opponent that hits the caster with any weapons or spells within this radius suffers 1d8+2 damage (half cold, half magic) and reduces the attacker's THAC0 by one point for 6 rounds (cumulative).</p>

<p><strong>Shadeskin</strong><br />
(Alteration – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 4<br />
Range: 0<br />
Duration: 12 hours<br />
Casting Time: 1<br />
Area of Effect: The caster<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>When a shadow adept casts this powerful spell upon &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;self, an outer skin of shadowstuff will move up from the ground, completely covering &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;. This skin is of course magical and will hinder the shadow adept in no way. The effect of this is to protect the shadow adept from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. For every 2 levels of the caster, an additional skin is gained upon casting. For example, a 10th-level shadow adept would receive 5 skins while a 20th-level shadow adept would receive 10. For each skin the shadow adept possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th-level shadow adept would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;, but the 6th would affect &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; normally. The skins will remain on the shadow adept until &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; is affected by a Dispel Magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell duration expires. It is important to note that this will not protect the shadow adept from any magical attacks, such as Fireball.</p>

<p>Additionally, so long as at least one layer of Shadeskin is active, the shadow adept gains 25% resistance to acid, cold, fire, electrical and magic damage.</p>

<p><strong>Sigil of Misfortune</strong><br />

Range: 50 ft.<br />
Duration: 2 rounds/level<br />
Casting Time: 4<br />
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>The spell allows the caster to adversely affect all the Saving Throws of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; enemies. The effect is applied to all hostile creatures within the area of effect. Opponents under the influence of this spell make all Saving Throws and attack rolls at a penalty of -4.</p>

<p>This spell is not affected by Magic Resistance.</p>

<p><strong>Summon Shadow</strong><br />
(Necromancy – Shadow Weave)<br />
Level: 4<br />
Range: Long<br />
Duration: 2 hours<br />
Casting Time: 1 round<br />
Area of Effect: Special<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>By means of this spell, the caster summons a number of shadows, undead monsters which serve the mage under any conditions. The type and number of creatures that appear depend upon the level of the shadow adept casting the spell.</p>

<p>7th: 3 shadows<br />
9th: 3 shadow fiends<br />
12th+ : 3 wraiths<br />
16th+ : 2 wraiths, 1 devil shade</p>

<p>The undead creatures will remain under the shadow adept's control until they are slain or the spell duration expires.</p>

<p>NOTE: Due to being creatures of the Plane of Shadow, shadows are weakened in natural daylight.</p>

<p><strong>Shar's Blessing</strong><br />
(Invocation/Evocation – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 4<br />
Range: 0<br />
Duration: 1 round/level<br />
Casting Time: 6<br />
Area of Effect: The caster<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>Through this spell, the caster draws upon energy from the Plane of Shadow to imbue &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;self with the strength and skill of a Fighter of the same level. The shadow adept's Strength score is increased by four points, &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; THAC0 becomes that of a Fighter of the same level, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; gains one extra attack per round and &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; gains 1 temporary Hit Point per level. This will last for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.</p>

<p>From 14th level onwards, the caster's attacks per round are doubled instead.</p>

Duration: Permanent<br />
Casting Time: 5<br />
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
Saving Throw: Special</p>

<p>The caster creates a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject’s subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast. Only the spell’s subject can see the phantasmal killer. The target first gets a Save vs. Spells to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Save vs. Death at +2 or die from fear. Even if the second save is successful, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage.</p>

<p><strong>Drain Vitality</strong><br />
(Necromancy – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 4<br />
Range: Touch<br />

Casting Time: 1<br />
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>This spell allows the shadow adept to drain four points of Constitution from a single target, increasing the caster's own for 1 turn. Drain Vitality (and its variants) does not cost Constitution as other spells of the Shadow Weave and may not affect the same target more than once per turn.</p>

<p><strong>Dread Whispers</strong><br />
(Illusion/Phantasm – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 4<br />
Range: 30 ft.<br />

Casting Time: 9<br />
Area of Effect: 30 ft. radius<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>Dread Whispers causes all enemies within range to become afflicted by an ominous chorus of voices infesting their mind. The voices are distracting, causing 50% spell failure on targets. In addition, at the beginning of every round after the first, the target must make a Save vs. Spell at -6 or lose morale, running in panic for 1 round.</p>

<p><strong>Negative Immunity</strong><br />
(Abjuration – Shadow Weave)</p>

Range: Visual range of the caster<br />
Duration: 1 turn<br />
Casting Time: 3<br />
Area of Effect: 1 creature and any enemy within 7.5 ft.<br />
Saving Throw: 1/2</p>

<p>With this spell, the shadow adept conjures a glob of shadowy, vaporous ooze from the Plane of Shadow and drops it on the target, dealing 6d6 acid damage to them and any nearby targets, holding them for 1 round (no save) then slowing them and reducing their magic resistance by 20% for 1 turn. Targets who make a Saving Throw vs. Death at -2 take half damage and avoid the secondary effects.</p>

<p>This spell is unaffected by Magic Resistance, but creatures that are immune to acid are unaffected.</p>

<p><strong>Wall of Black Flame</strong><br />

Saving Throw: 1/2</p>

<p>With this spell, the shadow adept creates a wall of black fire, dealing 4d6 damage (half fire, half magic) to all creatures who pass through it (Save vs. Spells at -4 for half) and reduces their Armor Class by -4 for one round. Creatures cannot take damage more than once per round.</p>

<p><strong>Pain Mirror</strong><br />
(Necromancy – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level; 4<br />
Range: Visual range of the caster<br />
Duration: 1 turn<br />
Casting Time: 7<br />
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>When the caster is struck with an attack, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; takes no damage and drains 1d4 hit points per level from the attacker instead.

<p><strong>Greater Shadowfade</strong><br />
(Illusion/Phantasm – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 4<br />
Range: Touch<br />
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level<br />
Casting Time: 4<br />
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>This spell is similar to Invisibility, but the recipient is able to attack by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting while remaining unseen. However, telltale traces – a shimmering – allow an observant opponent to attack the invisible spell recipient. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; presence known). Attacks against the invisible character suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls, and the invisible character's Saving Throws are made with a +4 bonus. Additionally, for as long as the caster is at least partially invisible, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; is healed for 2d6 hit points per round for the duration.</p>

<p>Note: After making an attack, the caster is no longer completely invisible. Opponents can target the caster. The caster is treated as Non-Detected for the duration.</p>

Saving Throw: 1/2</p>

<p>When this spell is cast, it generates a cone-shaped area of freezing ice originating at the shadow adept's hand and extending outwards of 30 ft. in a 90' cone in front of the caster. It drains heat and causes 1d4 cold damage plus 1% of all targets' maximum hit points in damage per level of the caster. For example, a 10th-level shadow adept would deal 10d4 (Save vs. Spell at -2 for half) plus 10% maximum hit points in cold damage. Targets who fail their saving throw are also slowed and take 1d6 extra cold damage per round for 2 rounds + 1 round per 4 caster levels.</p>

<p>This spell is similar to Invisibility, but the recipient is able to attack by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting while remaining unseen.

These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; presence known). Attacks against the invisible character suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls, and the invisible character's Saving Throws are made with a +4 bonus. For the duration of the spell, the shadow adept is also able to backstab with a x2 multiplier, increased to x3 at level 14 and x4 at level 21.</p>

<p>Additionally, the caster's movement rate is doubled, allowing for a quick retreat from battle if necessary.</p>

<p>Note: After making an attack, the shadow adept is no longer completely invisible. Opponents can target the shadow adept.</p>

Its natural weapon is capable of draining two levels on hit and strikes as a +4 weapon. However, nighthaunts are greatly weakened in natural daylight. From 14th level onwards, two nighthaunts are summoned instead.</p>

<p>The nighthaunt is fully under the control of the caster for the duration of the spell and will follow all of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; orders until the duration has expired.</p>

<a NAME="6TH"></a><h2>6th Level Spells</h2>

<p><strong>Shar's Shield</strong><br />

Range: 0<br />
Duration: 1 round/level<br />
Casting Time: 6<br />
Area of Effect: 5-ft. radius sphere<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd-, or 4th-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the Globe of Invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the globe. 5th- and higher level spells are not affected by the globe, and magical attacks of 5th-level or higher, such as Spellstrike and Pierce Magic, can bring it down.</p>

<p>Additionally, the shadow adept gains 20% magic resistance as long as the globe is up.</p>

<p><strong>Twin Mislead</strong><br />
(Illusion/Phantasm – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 6<br />
Range: 0<br />
Duration: 1 round/level<br />
Casting Time: 1<br />
Area of Effect: Special<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>When this spell is cast, the shadow adept is affected by an Improved Invisibility spell and is teleported a few feet away from &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; original position. Meanwhile, an exact image of the caster is created where &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; used to be, with exactly the same Hit Points as the caster. The image cannot perform any actions at all, such as attacking or casting spells. It can, however, move around and act as a decoy for the invisible shadow adept. The image will remain under control of the caster until reduced to 0 Hit Points, or until affected by a Dispel Magic or a spell that reveals illusions, such as True Sight.</p>

<p>After 3 rounds have passed, a second decoy is spontaneously created, regardless of whether or not the first has been destroyed.</p>

<p><strong>Protection From Weave-forged Weapons</strong><br />

<p>Level: 6<br />
Range: 0<br />
Duration: 4 rounds<br />
Casting Time: 1<br />
Area of Effect: The caster<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>When the spell is cast, it confers complete invulnerability to all magical weapons created using Weave magic. This includes weapons that are blessed or enchanted. The attacks of powerful monsters are also considered magical weapons. This spell cannot be cast on anyone who is protected from normal weapons as well as anyone protected by Mantle, Improved Mantle, or Absolute Immunity. Due to the nature of this spell, with the short casting time and duration, it is mainly used to buy the shadow adept a few rounds in the thick of combat. This effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.</p>

<p><strong>Power Word, Silence</strong><br />

Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>In using this spell, the shadow adept points at an individual and utters the Power Word. For the next 7 rounds, that creature cannot make any sound. This silence completely foils any spells that require verbal components. The only ways to counter this spell are either a Dispel Magic or a Vocalize spell. There is no Saving Throw and the spell ignores magic resistance.</p>

<p><strong>Black Lightning </strong><br />
(Invocation/Evocation – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 6<br />
Range: 40 ft.<br />
Duration: Instant<br />
Casting Time: 5<br />
Area of Effect: Special <br />
Saving Throw: 1/2</p>

<p>When the shadow adept casts Black Lightning, arcs of electrical energy burst from &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; fingertips. These brilliant arcs of lightning leap at all enemies near the caster, burning them with electrical and fire damage. The lightning causes 1d6 points of damage for every 2 levels of the caster and causes targets to go berserk for 3 rounds. If the target of the lightning saves vs. Spell, they avoid berserking and only half damage is inflicted. Thus, a 12th-level shadow adept will cause 6d6 (half electrical, half fire) damage to a victim (3d6 electrical if the victim makes &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Saving Throw vs. Spell).</p>

<p>When this spell is cast upon a target creature there will be two major effects. The first is that it will dispel one spell protection of 8th level or lower from the creature. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on the target first. If the target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. The second effect of the spell is that the creature's magic resistance is temporary nullified. The resistance remains lowered for 2 rounds, and this effect cannot be negated in any way. Additionally, mages will take 10d4 magic damage and suffer from a 50% chance of spell failure for 2 rounds. Spells affected by Pierce Magic are Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Spell Turning, Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, and Globe of Invulnerability. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.</p>

<p>Upon casting this spell, the shadow adept brings into being a shimmering, sword-like plane of force that leaps into &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; hands. The sword acts as a +4 weapon in all respects and deals 3d4 points of slashing damage and 2d4 cold damage upon hitting a target. Once the spell is cast, the sword will float in the air completely under the caster's control. This does not prevent the caster from doing any other actions during the spell's duration.</p>

Saving Throw: Special</p>

<p>When the caster utters the spell, he calls forth a swarm of venomous biting and stinging shadow creatures to plague the target. This carpet-like mass swarms over a large area, spreading to all creatures within 30 feet of the target. Invisibility is no protection.</p>

<p>For the duration of the spell, those affected fight with a -2 penalty to attack rolls and armor class. In addition, each round, the victims suffer 2d6 points of damage from bites, have a 100% chance of spell failure, and must make saving throws vs. Death at -2 or run away in fear. If a successful Save vs. breath at -6 is made, the target manages to avoid most of the swarm, reducing damage from bites by half and completely negating the spell failure penalty.</p>

For 1 turn, the target ally is resurrected with full hit points and dramatically increased power - the resurrected ally is hasted for the duration, Strength and Dexterity are set to 25, base AC is set to -6 and target gains immunity to all mind-affecting spells. The target deals maximum damage for the duration of the spell and their casting speed is increased by 4.

When the shadow adept casts this spell, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; causes one creature to fall into a deep sleep and become tormented with terrible nightmares. For each round that the target remains asleep, they must make a Save vs. Spell at -4 to wake up from the nightmare.

The target must make as Saving Throw vs. Spells at -7 or become directly controlled by the caster. The shadow adept loses control of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; body but may see through the eyes of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; target and use spells and abilities available to them. Additionally, the possessed target's Strength, Dexterity and Constitution are increased to 25 while they are possessed. Possess may not be dispelled and the target only regains control over their own body once the duration has ended or if the caster chooses to relinquish control of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; own volition.</p>

<p>Once the duration expires, the vertigo and shock of suddenly regaining control causes the target to suffer 5d10 non-lethal damage and fall unconscious for 5 rounds (no save).</p>

Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>When a shadow adept casts Shadow's Refuge, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; opens a gate to a safe (in relative terms) pocket area in the Plane of Shadow, where time passes more slowly and gives &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; time to rest and recuperate away from the present battle. For one turn, the shadow adept is safe from combat and &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; hit points are restored to full, and &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; regains two arcane spells of each spell level of 7th level and below when &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; returns. In addition, as the caster will be resting for a long period of time, all effects whether beneficial or otherwise will be removed when they return.</p>

<p>The shadow adept may choose to return from the refuge before its duration has expired, but &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; will only get partial benefits.</p>

For 4 rounds, the shadow adept gains a bonus of 20 to Armor Class, a +20 bonus to hit, +20 to all saves and immunity to backstabs. Due to this spell's short casting time and duration, it is mainly used to buy the shadow adept a few rounds in the thick of combat.</p>

For an indefinite amount of time, the shadow adept is unable to make any actions as &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; channels power into &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; party, providing a +4 bonus to all attributes, +6 to Armor Class, +4 to to-hit and damage modifiers, +50% magic resistance, +50% resistance to elemental damage and immunity to level drain. However, for each round the link is maintained, the caster loses 10% of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; hit points (Save vs. Death at -4 to avoid) and &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; is completely vulnerable to attack unless &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; breaks the connection. Additionally, if &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; ends the channel, the backlash causes &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; to become stunned for 2 rounds unless a Save vs. Death at -2 is made.</p>

Casting Time: 1 <br />
Area of Effect: 1 creature <br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>When Nightsinger's Tithe is uttered, one creature within the spell range is slain. The target must have 60 or fewer current Hit Points, otherwise the spell has no effect. There is no Saving Throw. Creatures slain by this spell have their souls sent to the Plane of Shadow as a sacrifice to Shar. There is an 50% chance that killing a target with this spell will permanently bestow 1 bonus hit point to the caster. Once 50 enemies have been slain with this spell, the shadow adept permanently gains +2 to Constitution, +1 to all saves and -1 casting time, and further castings of this spell will no longer grant hit points.</p>

<p><strong>Enervation</strong><br />
(Necromancy – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 9<br />
Range: Touch<br />
Duration: Permanent<br />
Casting Time: 3<br />
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>The casting of this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane, draining the target of two levels of experience every round for four rounds. A Saving Throw vs. Death at -4 can be made to avoid losing levels after the first round. The target of this spell loses levels, Hit Dice, Hit Points, and abilities permanently. These levels can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell. Additionally, the caster is restored of 1-4 lost spells of 8th level or below for every instance of level loss of the target.</p>

<p><strong>Black Blade of Disaster</strong><br />
(Invocation/Evocation – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 9<br />
Range: 0<br />
Duration: 18 rounds<br />
Casting Time: 4<br />
Area of Effect: Special<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>This spell enables the caster to create a black, blade-shaped planar rift about three feet long. It jumps into the caster's hand and is used as a normal sword, remaining there for the duration of the spell. The caster is considered to be proficient to the point of Grand Mastery in this weapon. The sword acts as a +5 weapon and deals 2-24 damage to its victims. Also, every time it hits a target, the victim must make a Save vs. Death at +4 or be disintegrated. There is also a 10% chance with every hit that the sword drains 4 levels from the target and heals the wielder 20 Hit Points.</p>

<p><strong>Weird</strong><br />
(Illusion/Phantasm – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 9<br />
Range: 0<br />
Duration: Instant<br />
Casting Time: 8<br />
Area of Effect: Special<br />
Saving Throw: Special</p>

<p>You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject’s subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast. Only the affected creatures see the phantasmal creatures attacking them, though you see the attackers as shadowy shapes. The target first gets a Save vs. Spells at -4 to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Save vs. Death at -2 or die from fear. If a subject succeeds, it still takes 3d6 points of damage and is stunned for 1 round. The subject also takes 1d4 points of temporary Strength damage.</p>

<p><strong>Death Mark</strong><br />
(Necromancy – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 9<br />
Range: 0<br />
Duration: Special<br />
Casting Time: 9<br />
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
Saving Throw: Special</p>

<p>This horrific spell marks a specific target with a curse that dooms them to an inevitable end. The victim suffers 15% of their maximum hit points in damage on the first round with no save. On the next round, they must make another Saving Throw vs. Death at -8 or suffer the same amount of damage, then on the next round, make another saving throw at -7, and so on until a save modifier of zero. The curse remains indefinitely until the target is either killed, the curse is dispelled or resisted, or a successful save is made.</p>

<p><strong>Oblivion Pull</strong><br />
(Abjuration – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 9<br />
Range: 30 ft.<br />
Duration: 3 rounds<br />
Casting Time: 9<br />
Area of Effect: 1 creature and any creature within 7.5 ft.<br />
Saving Throw: Special</p>

<p>When Oblivion Pull is cast, the shadow adept launches a tiny, fast-moving projectile towards a target which opens a portal using the target's body as a catalyst. When this happens, the portal pulls it and all other creatures within a 7.5 ft. radius into it and sends them to a small pocket in the Plane of Shadow where they are trapped indefinitely. The victim remains there unless the spell "Freedom" is cast. If a Freedom spell is cast in the area where the creature was imprisoned, then &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; will reappear exactly where &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; was last standing. Dispel Magic will not free creatures trapped in this manner. There is no Saving Throw against imprisonment for the target, but creatures within a 7.5 ft. radius may make a Save vs. Spells at -6 to resist being pulled into the portal.</p>

<p><strong>Fiery Pandemonium</strong><br />
(Invocation/Evocation – Shadow Weave)</p>

<p>Level: 9<br />
Range: 270 ft.<br />
Duration: 6 rounds<br />
Casting Time: 9<br />
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>When the caster utters the words to this powerful spell, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; calls upon powerful forces indeed. These forces bring forth a storm of shadow fire, dealing 6d10 fire and magical damage per round with no Saving Throw. Additionally, anyone within the storm must make a Saving Throw vs. Death each round or be petrified permanently. If a statue created by this spell is subjected to attacks of any sort, it will shatter into tiny pieces, making it impossible for the creature to be returned to flesh. The caster is well advised to be careful in &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; use of this spell.</p>

<p>This spell is not affected by Magic Resistance, but creatures that are immune to fire are unaffected.</p>

<p><strong>Mass Greater Drain Vitality</strong><br />
(Conjuration/Summoning)</p>

<p>Level: 9<br />
Range: Area centered on caster<br />
Duration: 1 turn<br />
Casting Time: 5<br />
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>This spell inflicts the effects of the Greater Drain Vitality spell upon every enemy creature within the area of effect, draining eight points of Constitution from each target for 1 turn. Drain Vitality (and its variants) does not cost Constitution as other spells of the Shadow Weave and may not affect the same target more than once per turn.</p>


<a NAME="SPA"></a><h2>Special Abilities</h2>

<p><strong>Shield of Shadows</strong>
<br />The shadow adept surrounds &lt;HIMHER&gt;self with a barrier of purpleblack force. This shield of shadows functions like a shield spell, setting &lt;HISHER&gt; armor class to 4 (2 against ranged weapons) and absorbing magic missiles cast at him for 1 hour per 2 levels to a maximum of 9 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Shadowstep</strong><br />
The character steps into the Shadow Plane and may move for 7 seconds while others are frozen in time. The caster cannot attack or cast spells while in the Shadow Plane.</p>

<p><strong>Shadow Double</strong><br />
The shadow adept creates a copy of himself out of shadowstuff. The copy is at 60% of the caster's level and has all the spells and abilities that the caster would have at that level.</p>

<p><strong>Find Shadow Familiar</strong><br />
This spell only needs to be cast once; upon casting, the shadow adept summons a creature from the Plane of Shadow to become &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; aide and companion. However, this magical contract made between the caster and summon requires a sacrifice from the shadow adept. Upon casting this spell, the shadow adept loses four points of Constitution which gradually recovers over the course of four weeks. However, as the summoned creature is not native to the Prime Material Plane and usually unliving, they cannot be 'killed' in battle and if they are destroyed will reform after 24 hours have passed with no harm dealt to their summoner. Shadow familiars grow stronger with their caster and gain new abilities upon their master reaching certain experience thresholds.</p>

<p>The creature summoned by this spell is determined by the caster's alignment on the law-chaos axis.</p>
