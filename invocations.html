Duration: 1 hour<br />

Area of Effect: the caster<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>
<p>The warlock can summon undead creatures with &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; infernal power to serve &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;. This invocation lasts for one hour. The strength and number of undead created is dependent on the warlock's level:</p>
<p>1st – 6th: a 3 HD skeleton warrior wielding a long sword.<br />
7th – 10th: a 5 HD skeleton warrior wielding a long sword +1.<br />
11th – 14th: a 7 HD skeleton warrior wielding a bastard sword +1.<br />
15th and up: a 9 HD skeleton warrior wielding a two-handed sword +1.<br />

<p>VORACIOUS DISPELLING<br />
(Abjuration)</p>
<p>Power: Lesser<br />
Effective Spell Level: 4<br />
Range: Touch<br />
Duration: Instant<br />
Casting Time: 3<br />
Area of Effect: One creature<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>
<p>This invocation attempts to dispel magical effects upon a target creature. This includes effects given from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the warlock and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Voracious Dispelling is above the original caster, &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Voracious Dispelling is below the original caster, &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; is trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly, if the warlock is 4 levels lower than the magic &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the warlock.</p>
<p>Additionally, regardless of whether the dispel is successful, the target takes one point of magical damage per two levels of the warlock.</p>
<p>WALK UNSEEN<br />
(Illusion/Phantasm)</p>

Saving Throw: Neg.</p>
<p>This eldritch essence invocation allows the warlock to change &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; eldritch blast into a bewitching blast. The bewitching blast reduces the Eldritch Blast's damage to d4, but forces any creature struck to make a Save vs. Spells at -2 (additional -1 penalty per two points of caster's Charisma above 17) or become confused. A confused target will either wander randomly, attack a random nearby creature (even allies), or simply stand still.</p>
<p>ELECTRIFYING BLAST<br />

Any creature struck by the attack must make a Save vs. Death at -2 (additional -1 penalty per two points of caster's Charisma above 17) or suffer a -2 penalty to all attributes and a -4 penalty to all saving throws.

<p>VITRIOLIC BLAST<br />
(Eldritch Essence)</p>
<p>Power: Greater<br />

Range: Special<br />
Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round/10 levels<br />
Casting Time: Same as blast shape<br>
Area of Effect: Same as blast shape<br>
Saving Throw: None</p>
<p>This eldritch essence invocation allows the warlock to change &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; eldritch blast into a vitriolic blast. A vitriolic blast deals acidic damage and is formed from conjured acid, making it different from all other eldritch essences because it ignores Magic Resistance. Creatures struck by a vitriolic blast automatically take an extra 2d6 points of acid damage on following rounds. A creature taking damage in this way never takes more than 2d6 points of acid damage in a round, even if it has been hit by more than one vitriolic blast. Creatures immune to acid damage are not affected.</p>
<p>CHILLING TENTACLES<br />

Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>
<p>This invocation allows you to conjure forth a field of soul-chilling tentacles that ooze from the ground, groping for victims. For every round that a creature is caught in the area of effect, it suffers an attack from tentacles, suffering 1d6+4 crushing damage and becoming paralyzed for one round on a failed Save vs. Breath. In addition, each creature within the area of the invocation takes 2d6 points of cold damage each round regardless of whether they are struck by any tentacles. The tentacles last for 4 rounds.</p>
<p>DEVOUR MAGIC<br />
(Abjuration)</p>
<p>Power: Greater<br />
Effective Spell Level: 6<br />
Range: 40 ft.<br />
Duration: Instant<br />
Casting Time: 3<br />
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>
<p>This invocation dispels the magical effects upon any enemies within the area. This includes effects given from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the warlock and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Devour Magic is above the original caster, &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Devour Magic is below the original caster, &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; is trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly, if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the warlock.</p>
<p>Additionally, for each enemy affected by Devour Magic, the warlock temporarily gains two extra hit points to &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; maximum for four rounds.</p>
<p>TENACIOUS PLAGUE<br />
(Conjuration/Summoning)</p>
<p>Power: Greater<br />

Range: Visual range of the caster<br />
Duration: 3 rounds<br />
Casting Time: 6<br />
Area of Effect: 15 ft. radius<br />
Saving Throw: None</p>
<p>The Tenacious Plague spell attracts a cloud or swarm of magical insects to that jump first to the target, then to the nearest allies of the target. This swarm gathers at a point chosen by the caster within the spell's range and attacks any single creature the caster points to. Each victim may make a Saving Throw vs. Breath Weapon with a -4 penalty to escape the swarm; otherwise, they receive 1 point of piercing damage and 1d4 points of magical damage every 2 seconds for the duration of the spell. Moreover, each victim fights with a -2 penalty to &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; attack roll and a -2 penalty to &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Armor Class. The swarm will repeatedly bite the target, making it very difficult to cast spells (50% chance of spell failure).</p>
<p>WALL OF PERILOUS FLAME<br />

Effective Spell Level: 6<br />

<p>This eldritch essence invocation allows the warlock to change &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; eldritch blast into a binding blast. The binding blast reduces the Eldritch Blast's damage to d4, but forces any creature struck to make a Save vs. Spells at -4 (additional -1 penalty per two points of caster's Charisma above 17) or be stunned.</p>

If a target ever has as many negative levels as Hit Dice, it dies. The effects of this invocation do not stack with further applications of utterdark blast.</p>

Casting Time: 4<br />
Area of Effect: The caster<br />

This shield not only grants the user 125% Fire Resistance, +50% to damage dealt from fire damage and an AC bonus of 4, but also protects &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; from attacks made within a 5-ft. radius. An opponent that hits the warlock with any weapons or spells within this radius suffers 2d10+2 fire damage. In addition, the intense heat protects the warlock from all weapons of below +3 enchantment.</p>
<p>However, this power comes at a cost. Each time the warlock uses this ability, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; takes one point of Constitution damage that lasts for the next 24 hours. Should &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Constitution drop to zero, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; will be killed instantly.</p>

<p>This eldritch essence invocation allows you to change your eldritch blast into a hellfire blast. A hellfire blast deals unmitigated fire damage and increases the Eldritch Blast's damage to d10. Hellfire is far hotter than regular fire and therefore is not affected by fire resistance.</p>
<p>However, this power comes at a cost. Each time the warlock uses this ability, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; takes one point of Constitution damage that lasts for the next 24 hours. Should &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Constitution drop to zero, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; will be killed instantly.</p>
